# Workout 3: R-package

Andrea (Drew) Galloro
Professor Sanchez

Third Workout assignment for STAT133 at UCB.

The focus of the assignment is to develop an R-package designed
to help people play with a binomial density. Includes safegaurds to
prevent someone from inputting invalid parameters, and includes print
methods for easy reading.

## Motivation

The purpose of this assignment is to get us used to building a package, and to get us to use information from throughout the course. This is includes things such as using testthat, github, writing functions, organizing files, and roxygen comments.
