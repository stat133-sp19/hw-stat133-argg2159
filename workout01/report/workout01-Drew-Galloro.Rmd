The warriors have become a sensation in the NBA. In the 2016 season they [beat the record](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_best_records.html) for the best season and best start (going 73-9 for the 2016 season and starting 24-0).

The Star player during all of this: Stephen Curry. Who also broke a record in making the most 3 pointers during the 2016 season and tied for most three pointers in a single game.
